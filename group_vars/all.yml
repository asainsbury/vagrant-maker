# Data to test, in groupvars
---
# Common vars just calling out all the things I can think of:
ssh_user: "user"
ssh_config: "~/.ssh/config"
projects_root: "~/projects/"
vagrant_root: "~/projects/vagrant/"
playbook_root: "~/projects/playbooks/"
host_path: "~/projects/inventory/"
host_file: "~/projects/inventory/hosts"

# These vars get called by the vagrant file
# The file ingests all this data
# Ansible version is used during the bootstrap, might need to be autgenerated
# as it will throw an error if testing with a python virtual env, hard coded for now

ansible_vagrant: "2.6.1"

# Some of this information is redundant and isn't called by anything, thats just a warning.
# Other varables
domain: "test.local"
primary: "8.8.8.8"
secondary: "8.8.4.4"
play: "vagrant-maker.yml"

# Box specific vars
# Dict of dicts in case we want to build out more data
centos7:
  box: "centos/7"
  box_url: 'https://vagrantcloud.com/centos/boxes/7'

ubuntuTrusty:
  box: "ubuntu/trusty64"
  box_url: "https://app.vagrantup.com/ubuntu/boxes/trusty64"

cisco_1000:
  box: "cisco/csr1000v"

cisco_9000:
  box: "n9000v"

# Host vars - but not in hostvars
# This format works great!!
# Vagrant reads in the dict of list, but it doesn't know about the other vars
# so for now you have to fully specify the box data, no shortcuts.
# probably can do this inside of the vagrant file, as we suck all that info in

# Bootstrap part passes the name into the play via vagrant, so you can't dedup that part
# but is does mean you can call differnet bootstraps for different hosts

# Remeber the state flag
# If you want to clean up the sshconfig, inventory file, and hosts file
# you can add the abscent flag before you destroy the vm
