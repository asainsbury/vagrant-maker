# Data to test, in groupvars
---
# Common vars just calling out all the things I can think of:
ssh_user: "user"
ssh_home: "/home/user/"
ssh_config: "~/.ssh/config"
projects_root: "~/projects/"
host_path: "~/projects/inventory/"
host_file: "~/projects/inventory/hosts"

box_list:
  - 'centos/6'
  - 'centos/7'
  - 'ubuntu/bionic64'

# These vars get called by the vagrant file
# The file ingests all this data

# Host vars - but not in hostvars
# This format works great!!
# Vagrant reads in the dict of list, but it doesn't know about the other vars
# so for now you have to fully specify the box data, no shortcuts.
# probably can do this inside of the vagrant file, as we suck all that info in

# Bootstrap part passes the name into the play via vagrant
# but is does mean you can call differnet bootstraps for different hosts

# Remeber the state flag!!!!!!
# If you want to clean up the sshconfig, inventory file, and hosts file
# you can add the abscent flag before you destroy the vm
