  #   ssh config
  #   inventory file
  # Really want to get this to run each time you provison the VM
  # then you don't have to worry about creating stuff, it just runs

  # To get rid of the state part, we need to do a jinja template, I think
  # Basically just want to run the vagrant provisioner to just do this
  # and take care of the ssh file and inventory if we delete stuff from all.yml

  # Still need to create the inventory file, as other plays outside of this project
  # will reference that file
